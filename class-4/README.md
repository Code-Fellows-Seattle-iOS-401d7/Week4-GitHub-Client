#Week 4 - Class 4
##Homework
* Embed your NavigationController in a TabBarController.
* Create a UserSearchViewController and assign it as a second tab. 
* Implement UserSearchViewController to search for users. But, instead of a table view, use a collection view to display the users avatar image.
* Upon clicking on a cell, implement a custom transition, and transition the image clicked on to a UserDetailViewController page that has their picture, name, and whatever other info you want pulled from the API.
* Implement Regex in your app. Use it to validate the characters the user types into the search bar. Extend String with this functionality.
* Implement WKWebView in your app. When a user clicks on a repo, show their repo's web page with WKWebView.
